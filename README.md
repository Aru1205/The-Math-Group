Curriculum for group 1 and 2
Welcome to the The-Math-Group wiki!

# Group 1

## Curriculum:

* Read Lang’s book first. When you get to Algebra 2 type stuff, use Garland side by side with Lang. So, read lang first, do his exercises, then do Garland’s exercises to make sure you can apply it.

* When you get to the Trig stuff in Lang’s book, either use Axler’s precalc book or another trig or precalc book side by side to make sure you can apply the material.

* Crack open Rudin’s book next. It will review the algebra 2 and precalc stuff in the very begining, and introduce set theory. You can work through Rudin to learn Limits (stuff that’s sometimes taught in pre calc). It’s also a key concept in calc and, in actuality, it’s important in high school math too, especially when you think about inverse functions, domains, codomains (which range is a subset of, you’ll learn more about this later) and continuity.

* Make sure you get friends or family who know what they’re doing to test you to make sure that you know what you think you know.

* Finish Rudin side by side in Calc class.

* Take multivariable calculus at a college during a summer session (like stanford or berkeley or harvard, and surprisingly UC Santa Cruz summer math classes are open to anyone, affordable, and are surprisingly more proof based than standard or try to take a class online through an online extension school like Harvard’s extension school or UC online (UC Santa Cruz’s Math 23 is surprisingly rigorous (uses Marsden and Tromba) and way better than a standard calculus class).
